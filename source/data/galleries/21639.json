  "profile": "The Jérôme Poggi Gallery was founded in August 2009 by the critic and art historian Jérôme Poggi. The gallery works alongside the production house Objet de Production, which Jérôme Poggi created in 2004 to promote the introduction of contemporary art into society at large. The two entities are installed in a shared 200 square meter space in the emerging Gare du Nord contemporary art district in Paris. The gallery's principal aim is to represent contemporary artists and introduce them into both economic and critical/historical spheres. Alongside its active role on the international art market, the gallery also mediates private and public art commissions and serves as a think tank for a new generation of collectors and patrons.\r\n\r\nAware that the profound transformations affecting the art scene require new tools of production, diffusion, and reflection, the Jérôme Poggi Gallery and Objet de production joined forces to create a hybrid tool that fuses commercial and political, critical and pedagogical modes of action. The joint structure endeavours thus to enact a new contemporary art trade. Programming The Jérôme Poggi Gallery both seeks out new prospects on the young contemporary art scene and promotes historic figures of recent contemporary art history. Linking intellectual and economic speculation, it operates both on the art market and in the critical sphere.\r\n\r\nToday the gallery represents a dozen international artistes of diverse generations: Julien Crépieux (France, born in 1979), Juliana Borinski (Brazil and Germany, born in 1979), Wesley Meuris (Belgium, born in 1977), Larissa Fassler (Canada, born in 1975), Cédrick Eymenier (France, born in 1974), Société Réaliste (Jean-Baptise Naudy, France, born in 1982 and Ferenc Grof, Hungary; born in 1972), Oleg Tcherny (Belarus, born in 1971), Isabelle Arthuis (France, Belgium, born in 1969), Bertrand Lamarche (France, born in 1966), Vittorio Santoro (Switzerland, Italy, born in 1962), Georges Tony Stoll (France, born in 1955), Kees Visser (Holland, born in 1948), Sophie Ristelhueber (France, born in 1949), Anna-Eva Bergman (Norway, France, 1909-1987).\r\n\r\nThe gallery organizes six or seven shows a year and works regularly with young curators and art critics such as Florence Ostende, Matteo Lucchetti, Marc Bembekoff, Edwin Carels, Rhama Khazam, Elodie Royer & Yoann Gourmel and Paul Galvez. For its thematic exhibitions, the gallery invites outside artists and to strengthen its collaboration with partner galleries. Such artists include : Attila Csörgö, Hubert Duprat, Marina Abramovic, AK Dolven, Mathieu Lehanneur, Cécile Bart, Per Barclay.",

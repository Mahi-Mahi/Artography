  "profile": "The \"Galerie de Medicis\" is located in the heart of the historic Parisien quarter, Le Marais.\r\nYou can find the gallery under the arches of the Place des Vosges.\r\n\r\nOfficially opened in 1612 as the Place Royale, the Place des Vosges was constructed on the orders of Henri IV and finally completed by Louis XIII.\r\n\"La place\" quickly became fashionable for hosting royal gatherings and large fêtes.\r\nIt was also popular locations for duels.\r\n\t\r\nThe historic significance of \"la place\" has only increased over time as many eminent French talents such as 'femme de lettres' Madame de Sévigné, and writers Victor Hugo and Théophile Gautier have all called 'La Place des Vosges' home.\r\n\r\nThe opulent, historic surrounding and the origginal 17 th century beams that make up the structure of the gallery pleasantly juxtapose the historic with contemporary.\r\n\r\nWe welcome you to the La Galerie de Medicis!",

  "profile": "The gallery is very young but very dynamic. It is creating solid partnerships all around the world and is more and more present in art fairs.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to satisfy a generation who suffers from a « shortage of images » and who needs a direct link to the piece of art. The concept of the gallery is therefore to show visually very efficient art.",

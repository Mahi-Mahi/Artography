It has continued to question the exhibition space around the concept \"chez l´un, L´AUTRE\".\r\n\r\nAlongside the work shown and exhibitions held at 57, rue de Bretagne, the gallery puts on as many one man / woman shows as possible for its artists.\r\n\r\nThese are often held outside the gallery space, in specific places which are carefully chosen to provide an echo for their works.",

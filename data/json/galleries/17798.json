  "profile": "The founder and director of KUNSTBUREAU, Jens Buettner, has practiced professional\r\nphotography for over 20 years. Further on he decided to put all his experience to discovering\r\nnew talents and helping them in their artistic projects. His solid know how in the sector and his\r\nanalytic look allows him to propose in each exhibition a high quality selection of works.\r\nMoreover, because of the strong bond he cultivates with his native land, he wishes to promote the\r\ngerman contemporary scene.\r\nIn order to set a panoramic of the german photography, rich and innovating, he has invited several\r\nartists whose style and personal mark supply a renewed image to the country's classics. The\r\nexpositions that will be presented in France respond to Jens Buettner's will to establish in Parisian\r\nsurroundings, a permanent space dedicated to german photography.\r\nKunstbureau is a unique place in France where one can discover and collect german\r\ncontemporary photography.",
